This is a prpject I have made around June 2023 during my training. 

It is a base for a blog with a CRUD which allows to read, create, edit and delete articles and comments.

The ReadMe.txt file contains all my notes during the project realisation (required by my tutor).

I didn't have enough time to add the authentication system and CSS but the main purpose was to practice PHP.
